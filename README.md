# Calculator App

I'm wrapping up my web dev fundementals course with creating a caluclator using HTML, CSS, and JS.

This project challenged me to move away from CSS Flexbox and use CSS Grid.

I also learned to troubleshoot logic around unexpected user behaviors on the calcualtor. This led to me finding a lot of bugs and working through fixing them.

This project taught me:
- Coding for funky user behavior and writing against it
- CSS Grid
- Patience and Persistence
